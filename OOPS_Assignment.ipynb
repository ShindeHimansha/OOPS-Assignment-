        "- OOP in Python organizes code using classes (blueprints) and objects (instances), promoting modularity, reusability, and scalability. It allows bundling data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Key principles include encapsulation (restricting access to data), inheritance (reusing properties and methods from a parent class), polymorphism (different classes using the same method differently), and abstraction (hiding implementation details).\n",
        "\n",
        "#2 What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "- A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) to store data and methods (functions) to define behaviors.\n",
        "- Classes help in structuring code by encapsulating related properties and functions into a single unit, promoting modularity and reusability.\n",
        "- In Python, a class is defined using the class keyword, and objects are created as instances of the class.\n",
